Distributed Databases are essential for data-intensive and Big Data applications as traditional databases are not enough for working with data-intensive and Big Data applications. The concept of distributed databases has been around for quite some time as it seems a variable option when these massive datasets outgrow a single system. In Distributed databases data is stored across different computers in different or the same physical locations. Distributed databases are highly available and provide efficiency in managing relational datasets. Another important aspect of distributed systems and databases is the CAP theorem instead of the ACID theorem where C is for consistency, A is for availability and P is for partition tolerance. CAP theorem states that in a distributed system environment the system can provide two properties out of the three and not all three at the same time. For example, if an application or service provides availability and consistency it can not provide partition tolerance at the same time. Many distributed storages for data-intensive computing are built following the CAP theorem.
