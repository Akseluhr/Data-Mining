The term Big Data has become popular nowadays due to its diffusion with the cloud computing technologies that support data-intensive applications. Big Data identifies datasets that become so massive that they cannot be handled using traditional databases. The existing relational database systems are not sufficient to process Big Data which requires the concepts of parallel computing on a number of different servers. Cloud computing technologies support data-intensive applications and processing of these Big Data. They provide large on-demand computation instances which can be used to process large and massive datasets along with optimized and distributed storage systems to store data. Cloud technologies also expose APIs and frameworks to work with the management of large data sets which can make the process easier.
