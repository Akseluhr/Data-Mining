Programming models and storage systems support data-intensive computing. These two are the main technologies for data-intensive computing and here we will discuss the storage systems part of the technology. Data can be classified into two categories for storage purposes that is structured data and unstructured data. Structure data means that there is a predefined schema for the data and is stored in the storage according to the schema. Unstructured data on the other hand is data with no format or predefined schema stored in the storage and is not processed until its used. An example of structured data is relational databases which can be queried using a query language like SQL. Example of unstructured data is streaming data, weblogs, IoT sensors data etc.
